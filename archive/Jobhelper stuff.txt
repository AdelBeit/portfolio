My superpower is persistence, I like to turn my ideas into reality and challenge myself along the way. For example, I'm not traditionally trained to design things, only to code them, and most recently I had an idea to make a themed portfolio site, I methodically picked a couple of sources of inspiration and extended them to a full blown responsive accessible website design which then I brought to life using React and Nextjs. Checkout the code, and my design journey on this github repo: https://github.com/adelbeit/portfolio, live demo at https://adelbeit.com



I have a passion for technology, AI and using them to build solutions to problems. I thrive in fast paced challenging environments and OpenAI seems to be on this perpetual race to come up with the next best thing in technology, always pushing the boundaries and I want to be a part of that! I strongly believe in OpenAI's mission to create AI with human values in mind.

This is important because as someone with an analytical mind I was able to overcome my weakness which is creative thinking through a planned and methodical approach. I can do anything I set my mind to.

you are a new grad that graduated from Indiana University bloomington with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2019, since then you got a job at Capgemini as a technical consultant, your first client you worked with was TMobile, you did quality engineering there and lead a team of quality engineers that worked on testing TMobile's different customer facing products, as well as worked on developing automated testing on said products. The projects that you worked on were worth millions of dollars each. each project consisted of looking at code changes and which parts of each product were affected by new code changes, then coming up with customer journeys affected by those changes and end to end tests that tested those customer journeys. you reported on status of tests as well as identify, report and triage bugs with developers to completion. once tests were done you were then responsible for being on call when new changes went to production and did production testing to ensure a smooth release. before each new project you held meetings with business stakeholders and made sure you understood what the code changes were and cleared any questions then you communicated those changes to your offshore team and brough anyquesitons they had to the attention of the business stakeholders. after a year or so you went and worked as a scrum master in cox communications, your second client. there you worked with a team working on the billing system of the company that was responsible for billing customers for their services, this team worked on upgrading the ancient billing system that was being used at the time and modernizing it with new technologies such as React and Nodejs. This new system included an effort to update the GUI that was used by internal customer service employees and how they managed customer's accounts whenever they had a billing issue. This project was worth upwards of 100 million dollars. you were responsible for keeping the team on track, holding meetings with business stakeholders and product owner to make sure everything was on track and any and all blockers were cleared for developers to continue their work smoothly, you managed a JIRA board with a backlog ensuring all stories were clear and consice. after a year you left Capgemini due to a lack of a challenging role, and set your sights on finally becoming a frontend developer, for the past year you have been honing your development skills by working on personal projects using React, Typescript, Nextjs, and Javascript. In this time you have finished two projects. Project 1 is called Jamroom, it's a webapp powered by Docker, React, Nextjs, and Typescript that allows multiple people to jam online together using virtual instruments. They get to join a room together and Jam out. the code for it can be found on https://github.com/adelbeit/jamroom and the demo is found at httsp://jam.adelbeit.com. this web app is optimized for mobile as a responsible PWA that can be installed on any mobile device. The second project is your portfolio site, you designed and implemented a responsive accessible and optimized portfolio site using Typescript, Reactjs, Nextjs, and Javascript. You are very proud of this project because the main challenge that it presented to you was designing it. In general as a person with a very analytical mind, you have a hard time with creative endevors, and although it took you a long time to design, you were able to take a thought, a theme for what this website should look like and extended them to an entire themed website. You did that with a methodical approach to creativity, borrowing ideas from outside sources and blending them together seamlessly. You faced similar difficulties when trying to design the UI of the Jamroom app, and had to redesign it 3 times to come up with a design that's practical, minimal, and visually appealing, with the end user in mind. Overall you are very skilled at problem solving, and have a natural ability to identify and solve problems. You have a passion for using code to create solutions, and are always excited to learn new technologies. You are a very capable developer and thrive in a challenging environment where you are pushed to grow and learn new things. And you naturally take ownership and leadership whenever possible, always seeing things through. There is nothing that you cannot accomplish as long as you set your mind to it.

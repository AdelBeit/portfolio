    "Curious with a natural tendency to identify and solve problems, I enjoy building and tinkering with things. Coding is my favorite creative outlet, but I also enjoy other forms of creativity such as art, cooking, music, dancing, and photography. In my spare time, I love exploring new things, whether it be trying out new foods, finding new music or tv shows, traveling to new places, making new connections, or discovering new hobbies. I’m a lifelong learner that’s passionate about learning, creating, and connecting. I’m always eager for new opportunities to better myself and the world around me.",

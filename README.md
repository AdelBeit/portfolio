# Portfolio

This is made to showcase my technical abilities and creative capacity. It will house all my noteworthy projects as well as my contact info.

This project was made possible with the following technologies:

- NextJS
- Typescript
- React
- Zustand
- React-Sound
- Figma (design)

I'm proud to say all graphics are scalable SVGs, and aside from the branded icons, all other SVG has been handwritten and animated!

Additionally, all the JS/CSS animations are hand coded and dependency-free, the project as a whole is largely independent of third party libraries, as the goal was to showcase my abilities not others' With the exception of glitch text effect, shout out to [Matt Gross](https://codepen.io/mattgrosswork/pen/VwprebG) for this sleek css animation!

The design process took a considerable time and effort, the design went through multiple iterations. My creative process is documented in the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/JUEctQmR08xNzqwN9ilOFN/Portfolio-website?node-id=0%3A1&t=MYN0w9hptbceplVJ-1)
